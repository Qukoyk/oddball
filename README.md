Python scripts for oddball analysis

Students will have a class named "Laboratory Work in Psychology A" in their junior year, learning how to record erp(event-related potential) and analysis wave data. Every year we use a Matlab script which was written years ago. This year, we upgraded Matlab to 2019 version and the script didn't work anymore. Since professor was very busy and no one know much about matlab, I wrote some small scipts to analyze wave data.
